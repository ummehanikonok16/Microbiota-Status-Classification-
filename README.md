# Microbiota-Status-Classification-
This project involves an end-to-end data science workflow focused on healthcare data, using exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and baseline machine learning models Baseline Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Advanced Models: ANN, LightGBM, ransformer-Based Model: TabNet.

## üìä Project Overview

The notebook performs a comprehensive analysis of healthcare-related data with the goal of building predictive models. Key stages in the pipeline include:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Preprocessing
- Feature Engineering
- Handling Class Imbalance using SMOTE
- Baseline Modeling using machine learning classifiers
- Model Evaluation with ROC-AUC and confusion matrix
- Model Interpretability with SHAP

## üóÇÔ∏è Dataset Description

The dataset used in this notebook is:

**Filename:** `health_data_10000_chunk.csv`  
**Location:** Mounted from Google Drive (`/content/drive/MyDrive/SM technology/`)
This data has 1 target colum named "Current status of microbiota" and 55 feature column among them top 20 imporatnt features are given below:

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

To run this notebook:

1. Clone the repository or download the `.ipynb` file.
2. Open in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) for easiest compatibility (especially for mounting Google Drive).
3. Install dependencies (within Colab or locally):

```bash
pip install shap optuna imbalanced-learn scikit-learn pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

4. Mount Google Drive (in Colab):

```python
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')
```

5. Load the dataset and execute each cell step-by-step.

## ‚úÖ Key Results

Preprocessing:

Handled missing values

Encoded categorical variables

Scaled numerical features

SMOTE: Used to handle class imbalance

Models: Baseline ML models such as logistic regression and random forest

Metrics:

roc_auc_score for classification performance

confusion_matrix to inspect prediction correctness

classification_report showing precision, recall, and F1-score

Interpretability:

SHAP values computed for model transparency and feature importance analysis

## üìå Notes

- Make sure the dataset path is correctly set after mounting your Google Drive.
- Visualizations and outputs are embedded in the notebook for intuitive analysis.
